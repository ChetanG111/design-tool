# Project Overview

## Purpose
The Design Tool is a guided landing-page generator designed to simplify the creation of high-quality, consistent web pages. It focuses on a "constrained customization" model where users make high-level decisions rather than granular design edits.

## Current Scope
The application currently functions as a prototype for the guided selection flow. It supports:
- Basic app shell and navigation.
- A linear workflow for selecting project intent, colors, and layout preferences.
- A live preview of the current configuration.
- A single-file HTML export stub.
